# AI Research Skills - Structure Verification

**Date**: November 6, 2025
**Verified Skills**: 3/15 complete

## ✅ Verified Structure (Correct & Intentional)

Each skill follows this standard structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file (metadata + quick reference)
├── references/           # Organized documentation by category
│   ├── index.md         # Category index with page counts
│   ├── category1.md     # Full content for category 1
│   ├── category2.md     # Full content for category 2
│   └── ...
├── assets/              # EMPTY - Reserved for user-added files (images, etc.)
└── scripts/             # EMPTY - Reserved for user-added scripts
```

- `scripts/` - Empty (intentional)

**Total**: 185 pages scraped

### 3. PyTorch FSDP (8-distributed-training/pytorch-fsdp/)
⚠️ **Status**: Limited coverage (only 3 pages)

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` - 5.2 KB
- `references/` - 2 category files
- `assets/` - Empty (intentional)
- `scripts/` - Empty (intentional)

**Total**: 3 pages scraped (needs expansion)

## 📝 Key Findings

### ✅ Correct Behavior

1. **Empty `assets/` and `scripts/` folders are INTENTIONAL**
   - These are placeholder directories for users to add their own files
   - Not a bug or missing data
   - Per Skill Seeker design in the original codebase

2. **All actual documentation is in `references/` folder**
   - Organized by auto-detected categories
   - Each category has full content from scraped pages
   - `index.md` provides navigation

3. **`SKILL.md` is compact by design**
   - Contains metadata (name, description, tags)
   - Quick reference with common patterns extracted from docs
   - NOT the full documentation (that's in references/)

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **PyTorch FSDP has very limited coverage**
   - Only 3 pages vs target of 200
   - URL pattern filter may be too restrictive
   - Need to expand include pattern beyond just "fsdp"

## 📁 Directory Organization

All skills properly organized in semantic directories:

```
claude-ai-research-skills/
├── 3-fine-tuning/
│   └── axolotl/          ✅ 185 pages
├── 8-distributed-training/
│   ├── deepspeed/        ✅ 144 pages
│   └── pytorch-fsdp/     ⚠️ 3 pages (limited)
├── 1-model-architecture/  (empty)
├── 2-tokenization/        (empty)

└── 10-optimization/       (empty)
```

## ✅ Conclusion

**Structure is 100% correct!**

- Empty `assets/` and `scripts/` folders are by design
- All documentation properly organized in `references/`
- Skills are production-ready for Claude AI
- Only issue: PyTorch FSDP needs broader scraping pattern

**No bugs detected** - the structure matches the Skill Seeker design exactly.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. ✅ Continue scraping remaining 12 skills
2. ⚠️ Consider expanding PyTorch FSDP config to scrape more pages
3. ✅ Package completed skills as .zip for Claude upload
